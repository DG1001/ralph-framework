## 🎯 How It Works

### Phase 0: Specification Generation

1. You create `plan.md` with your project idea
2. Ralph (using Sonnet) reads it and generates:
   - Detailed specifications in `specs/`
   - Implementation plan in `fix_plan.md`
   - Project documentation
3. Script pauses for you to review
4. You can adjust specs if needed

### Phase 1: Implementation

1. Ralph works through `fix_plan.md` autonomously
2. For each task:
   - Searches codebase (avoid duplication)
   - Implements feature fully (no placeholders)
   - Writes and runs tests
   - Updates documentation
   - Commits to git
   - **Decides next model** (Haiku or Sonnet)
3. Self-selects between:
   - **Haiku** (80-90%): Fast, efficient for standard tasks
   - **Sonnet** (10-20%): Smart, for complex/critical tasks
4. Stops when all TODOs complete

### Phase 2: Refinement

1. Run with `--refine` flag
2. Ralph analyzes entire codebase
3. Identifies improvements:
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance issues
   - Code quality improvements
   - Missing features
   - Documentation gaps
4. Creates new prioritized TODO list
5. Run `./ralph.sh` again to implement refinements

## 🤖 Subagents (Optional but Recommended)

Ralph can use specialized subagents for **5-10x faster execution** and better context management.

### What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI workers that handle specific tasks in parallel:

| Subagent | Role | Model | Parallel? |
|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| **searcher** | Finds code in codebase | Haiku | ✅ Yes (5-10x) |
| **tester** | Runs tests and analyzes results | Haiku | ❌ No (1 at a time) |
| **reviewer** | Reviews code quality | Sonnet | ❌ No (1 at a time) |
| **documenter** | Updates documentation | Haiku | ✅ Yes (2-5x) |
| **spec_writer** | Writes specifications | Sonnet | ✅ Yes (5-10x) |

### Benefits

**Without Subagents:**
- Primary context does everything
- Sequential operations
- Context window fills quickly
- Slower for large codebases

**With Subagents:**
- Primary context = Scheduler
- Subagents = Workers
- Parallel searching (5-10x faster)
- Tests in isolated context
- Cleaner primary context

### Enabling Subagents

Subagents are **automatically enabled** if `subagents.json` exists in your project root.

The file is included in this repository, so subagents work out of the box!

### Disabling Subagents

If you want to run without subagents:
```bash
# Temporarily disable
mv subagents.json subagents.json.disabled

# Run Ralph
./ralph.sh

# Re-enable
mv subagents.json.disabled subagents.json
```

### Subagent Configuration

The `subagents.json` file defines all available subagents:
```json
{
  "searcher": {
    "description": "Finds code in codebase",
    "prompt": "Search thoroughly using grep, ripgrep, and file inspection...",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "haiku"
  },
  "tester": {
    "description": "Runs tests and analyzes results",
    "prompt": "Run tests and provide clear summaries...",
    "tools": ["Read", "Bash"],
    "model": "haiku"
  },
  ...
}
```

You can customize these or add your own subagents!

### Parallelism Strategy

Ralph follows these rules:

✅ **Run in Parallel** (fast, safe):
- Multiple **searcher** subagents (5-10 simultaneously)
- Multiple **documenter** subagents (2-5 simultaneously)

⚠️ **Run Sequentially** (prevent issues):
- Only **1 tester** at a time (prevents backpressure)
- Only **1 reviewer** at a time (expensive)

## 🎮 Commands
```bash
# Start Ralph (generate specs or continue implementation)
./ralph.sh

# Skip spec review, go directly to implementation
./ralph.sh --skip-review

# Refinement mode (after implementation complete)
./ralph.sh --refine

# Show help
./ralph.sh --help

# Monitor progress (separate terminal)
./tools/monitor.sh

# Analyze model decisions
./tools/analyze.sh
```

## 🧠 Model Selection Strategy

Ralph intelligently selects the optimal model for each task:

### Haiku (Default - Fast & Efficient)

**Used for ~80-90% of tasks:**
- CRUD operations
- Forms and validation
- UI components
- Simple API endpoints
- Standard database queries
- Bug fixes
- Writing tests
- Documentation updates

**Why?** Fast, cost-effective, handles routine work excellently.

### Sonnet (Complex Tasks)

**Used for ~10-20% of tasks:**
- Initial project setup
- Database schema design
- Authentication systems
- Security implementations
- Complex business logic
- API architecture
- Performance optimization
- Critical code reviews

**Why?** More capable for complex reasoning and critical decisions.

### Self-Selection

At the end of each loop, Ralph **analyzes the next task** and decides:
- Reads next item from `fix_plan.md`
- Evaluates complexity
- Writes decision to `.ralph/next_model.txt`
- Documents reasoning in `.ralph/model_reason.txt`

**Example decision:**
```
# .ralph/next_model.txt
haiku

# .ralph/model_reason.txt
Next task: Create user profile form - standard CRUD operation, 
follows existing patterns in codebase
```

You can review all decisions in `.ralph/decision_history.log`

## 📊 Monitoring and Analysis

### Real-time Monitoring
```bash
./tools/monitor.sh
```

Shows:
- Current phase
- Next model decision
- Progress percentage
- Recent commits
- Upcoming tasks

### Decision Analysis
```bash
./tools/analyze.sh
```

Shows:
- Model usage statistics
- Common reasons for Sonnet selection
- Recent decisions
- Overall efficiency

### Subagent Monitoring (if enabled)
```bash
./tools/monitor_subagents.sh
```

Shows subagent activity and parallel operations.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Interrupting and Resuming

Ralph can be interrupted anytime:
```bash
# Interrupt
Ctrl+C

# Resume later
./ralph.sh  # Continues where it left off
```

State is saved automatically.

### Custom Subagents

Add your own subagents to `subagents.json`:
```json
{
  "api_tester": {
    "description": "Tests API endpoints",
    "prompt": "Test API endpoints thoroughly, check status codes, response formats...",
    "tools": ["Bash", "Read"],
    "model": "haiku"
  }
}
```

### Manual Phase Control

Override phase if needed:
```bash
# Force back to implementation
echo "1" > .ralph/phase.txt
./ralph.sh

# Force refinement mode
echo "1-complete" > .ralph/phase.txt
./ralph.sh --refine
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Good plan.md Files

✅ **Do:**
- Be specific about core features
- Mention any critical requirements
- Include inspiration/similar projects if helpful
- Specify tech preferences if you have them

❌ **Don't:**
- Write implementation details (Ralph figures that out)
- Be too vague ("make a website")
- Over-specify everything (trust Ralph)

### During Development

✅ **Do:**
- Review generated specs before implementation
- Let Ralph finish its tasks
- Monitor progress periodically
- Review commits occasionally

❌ **Don't:**
- Edit files while Ralph is running
- Rush through spec review
- Interrupt unnecessarily
- Micromanage every decision

### After Implementation

✅ **Do:**
- Test the application thoroughly
- Run refinement analysis
- Review code quality
- Check security aspects

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Ralph Gets Stuck
```bash
# Check current state
cat .ralph/phase.txt
cat fix_plan.md

# Reset to implementation phase
echo "1" > .ralph/phase.txt
./ralph.sh
```

### Model Decision Not Made

Ralph should decide next model automatically. If not:
```bash
# Manually set to haiku
echo "haiku" > .ralph/next_model.txt
echo "Manual override" > .ralph/model_reason.txt
```

### Subagents Not Working
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la subagents.json

# Validate JSON
cat subagents.json | jq .

# Check Claude Code supports subagents
claude --version
```

### Tests Failing in Loop

Ralph will attempt to fix failing tests. If stuck:
1. Review the test output
2. Check `.ralph/decision_history.log`
3. Manually fix if needed
4. Commit and continue

### Out of Context

If Ralph runs out of context:
1. It will automatically compact
2. Or commit current work and continue
3. Subagents help prevent this!

## 📖 Documentation

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- All code runs locally
- Claude Code accesses only your project directory

- Credentials/secrets should be in `.env` (gitignored)
- Review generated code before deploying

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with clear, focused projects
2. **Good Specs**: Take time to review generated specs
3. **Let It Work**: Avoid interrupting Ralph mid-task
4. **Use Subagents**: They make Ralph much faster
5. **Monitor Progress**: Check in periodically
6. **Trust the Process**: Ralph learns and improves each loop
7. **Refine Later**: Don't expect perfection in Phase 1
8. **Review Code**: Always review before deploying
