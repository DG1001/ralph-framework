# 🤖 Ralph Framework

Universal autonomous development framework. Describe your project, Ralph builds it.

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/DG1001/ralph-framework.git my-project
cd my-project

# 2. Create your project plan
cp plan.md.template plan.md
# Edit plan.md with your project description

# 3. Start Ralph
./ralph.sh
# Ralph generates specs and pauses for review

# 4. Review specs, then continue
./ralph.sh
# Ralph implements everything

# 5. When complete, refine
./ralph.sh --refine
# Ralph suggests improvements
```

## 📋 How It Works

### Phase 0: Specification Generation
1. You write `plan.md` (your project idea)
2. Ralph reads it and generates detailed specs
3. Ralph creates `fix_plan.md` (implementation TODO list)
4. Script pauses for you to review

### Phase 1: Implementation  
1. Ralph works through `fix_plan.md` autonomously
2. Self-selects between Haiku (fast) and Sonnet (complex)
3. Commits after each feature
4. Stops when all TODOs complete

### Phase 2: Refinement
1. Run with `--refine` flag
2. Ralph analyzes codebase
3. Suggests improvements beyond original specs
4. Creates new TODO list
5. Run `./ralph.sh` again to implement

## 🎮 Commands
```bash
# Generate specs and start implementation
./ralph.sh

# Skip spec review, go directly to implementation
./ralph.sh --skip-review

# Refinement mode (after implementation complete)
./ralph.sh --refine

# Help
./ralph.sh --help
```

## 🎯 Example Projects

### Simple TODO App
```markdown
# plan.md
## Project Name
Simple TODO Manager

## Description
Web-based TODO app with user auth

## Core Features
- User registration/login
- CRUD for TODOs
- Mark complete
- Filter by status
```

### E-Commerce Platform
```markdown
# plan.md
## Project Name
Boutique E-Commerce

## Description
Small online store with product catalog and checkout

## Core Features
- Product catalog with categories
- Shopping cart
- Checkout with payment
- Order management
- Admin panel
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- Claude Pro subscription (recommended) or API key
- Git
```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

## 🧠 Model Strategy

Ralph intelligently selects models:

- **Haiku (80-90%)**: CRUD, forms, UI, simple logic
- **Sonnet (10-20%)**: Setup, architecture, security, complex logic

You can monitor decisions in `.ralph/decision_history.log`

## 🔍 Monitoring
```bash
# Watch Ralph work (separate terminal)
./tools/monitor.sh

# Analyze model decisions
./tools/analyze.sh
```

## 🎛️ Interrupting and Resuming

Ralph can be interrupted anytime (Ctrl+C):
- State is saved
- Next run continues where it left off
- Safe to interrupt between loops
